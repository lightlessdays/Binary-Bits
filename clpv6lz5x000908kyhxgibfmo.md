Sir Isaac Newton discovered the spectrum of colors within sunlight by passing it through a prism, showing a range from violet to red. Visible light, perceived by humans, constitutes a small portion of the broader electromagnetic spectrum, with radio waves on one end and gamma rays on the other.

The electromagnetic spectrum can be expressed in terms of wavelength, frequency, or energy. Wavelength and frequency are related by the speed of light, while energy is proportional to frequency. The visible spectrum spans approximately 0.43 to 0.79 millimeters, divided into colors from violet to red.

**Wavelength**  
Formula: *λ*⋅*f*\=*c*  
*λ* (lambda) = Wavelength of the electromagnetic wave (meters)  
*f* = Frequency of the wave (Hertz) = 1/time period  
*c* = Speed of light

**Energy of Electromagnetic Waves:**  
Formula: *E*\=*h*⋅*f*  
*E* = Energy of the wave (in Joules or electron-volts)  
ℎ = Planck's constant  
*f* = Frequency of the wave (Hertz)

The perceived color of an object is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects. Objects reflecting balanced light across visible wavelengths appear white, while those favoring specific wavelengths exhibit colors. For instance, green objects reflect light primarily in the 500 to 570 nanometer range.

Light without color is termed monochromatic or achromatic, with its only attribute being intensity. Monochromatic light spans from black to gray to white, forming the grayscale, often used to describe monochromatic images.

Descriptions of chromatic light involve radiance, luminance, and brightness. In addition to frequency, three other quantities are used to describe a chromatic light source: radiance, luminance, and brightness. Radiance is the total amount of energy that flows from the light source, and it is usually measured in watts (W). Luminance, measured in lumens (lm), gives a measure of the amount of energy an observer perceives from a light source. For example, light emitted from a source operating in the far infrared region of the spectrum could have significant energy (radiance), but an observer would hardly perceive it; its luminance would be almost zero. Finally, brightness is a subjective descriptor of light perception that is practically impossible to measure. It embodies the achromatic notion of intensity and is one of the key factors in describing color sensation.

Imaging primarily relies on electromagnetic wave radiation. However, alternate methods like ultrasonic imaging (using reflected sound), electron microscopy (using electron beams), and software-generated synthetic images also contribute to digital imaging. However, the limitation is that the wavelength of electromagnetic waves needed to observe an object must be comparable to or smaller than the object's size. For instance, studying small objects like water molecules would require high-energy ultraviolet or low-energy X-ray bands.
